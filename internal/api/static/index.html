    <h1 id="hangman-api">HangMan API</h1>
    <p>This API is <strong>easy to use</strong>, since it is designed for data consumption, although you can also enter
      hints with their respective responses (you will see this in depth later). The API is in charge of
      <strong>returning you the hint together with its answer and the length of this answer</strong> thanks to the fact
      that <strong>you will pass it a value through a <em>URL</em></strong>, the value would be the ID of the record to
      which you want to obtain the values mentioned above.</p>
    <p>The API Github repo is: <a
        href="https://github.com/hbourgeot/hangman-api">https://github.com/hbourgeot/hangman-api</a></p>
    <h2 id="get-hangs">Get Hangs</h2>
    <p>Getting your ‘<em>Hang</em>’ (I’ll call the <strong>returned hint, response and response length</strong>) is very
      simple, just use the following URL template:</p>
    <pre><code>https://www.henrry.online/api/get/hangman?id=X
      </code></pre>
    <p>Remember that you must change the X for the ID that you want. Now, let’s try to receive the <strong>data from the
        API</strong>, for this, I will use JS, first create an async function, inside this make a try-catch block and
      inside the try block declare a constant with the name “result”, that will store the promise of the fetch to the
      API website, and after making this line of code, declare a constant with the name you want to store the value of
      the result.json(). If you are confused, take a guide from the following code:</p>
    <pre><code>async function getHangman() {
        try {
        const result = await fetch(
        "https://www.henrry.online/api/get/hangman?id=1",{ method: "GET",}
        );
        const db = await result.json();
        console.log(db);
        } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
        }
        }

        getHangman();
      </code></pre>
    <p>And then, <strong>open the console of your web browser</strong> and you will notice that you have the JSON of
      your ‘<em>Hang</em>’, then from here, it’s up to you how you design the game. But to help you, I will tell you the
      specific function of each variable.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hint: store the hint so you can guess and there is no hangman, note that it MUST be in English, you could buy
        a coffee if you want me to store hintin other languages ;)</li>
      <li>Answer: stores the answer to the given hint, this SHOULD also be in English.</li>
      <li>AnswerLenght: stores the length of the response, obviously. This will help you create the necessary spaces to
        display to the user.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="create-hangs">Create Hangs</h2>
    <p>To create a Hang, the model to follow is very similar, you only have to change the ID parameter for the hint and
      answer parameters, as you can see in the following example:</p>
    <pre><code>https://www.henrry.online/api/new/hangman?hint=new+hint&amp;answer=hint+answer
      </code></pre>
    <p>Note that if you want the parameters to have spaces, you must <strong>concatenate them using the plus
        symbol</strong>, after you have finished passing a parameter, continue using “&amp;”, again I remind you that if
      you want this API to control more languages, you can buy me a coffee ;)</p>
